						** SUBARRAYS**

A subarray is a portion of an array that can be selected by specifying two indices, a starting index and an ending index.
In Java, arrays are indexed starting at 0, so the first element of an array is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.
To create a subarray, you can use the Arrays.copyOfRange() method, which takes in three parameters: the original array, the starting index, and the ending index.
The method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array within the specified range.
The returned subarray has the same component type as the original array.
For example, if you have an array int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and you want to create a subarray of the elements from index 1 to index 3, you can use the following code:

int[] subarray = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, 1, 4);

This will create a new array subarray containing the elements 2, 3, 4.
It's important to note that the copyOfRange() method does not modify the original array and returns a new array with the specified range of elements.
You can also use loops or the System.arraycopy() method to create subarrays.
The System.arraycopy() method is a built-in method in Java that allows you to copy elements from one array to another.
You can use this method to create a subarray by specifying the original array, the starting index of the subarray, the destination array, the starting index of the destination array, and the number of elements to copy.

int[] subarray = new int[3];
System.arraycopy(arr, 1, subarray, 0, 3);

This will copy the elements from index 1 to index 3 of the original array arr to the subarray subarray.

Another way to create a subarray is by using a loop. You can iterate through the original array, starting at the specified starting index and ending at the specified ending index, and add the elements to a new array.


int[] subarray = new int[3];
for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
    subarray[i-1] = arr[i];
}

This will create a new array subarray and fill it with the elements from index 1 to index 3 of the original array arr.

It's also possible to create subarrays using the slice() method in the Arrays class, but it's not supported by Java and it's not a standard library.

It's important to note that when working with subarrays, you must take care of the indexing, to avoid going out of bounds and causing an exception.

			** array.length and String.length()**
			
The length property of an array is a final variable that is a property of the array class and it's used to get the number of elements in an array. It's a public, non-static and final field. Since it's a property and not a method, it doesn't need to be called using parentheses.

On the other hand, the length() method of a String is a method provided by the String class, which returns the number of characters in the string. Methods are called using parentheses and a set of parentheses is used to differentiate it from the property.

 we don't use parentheses when using array.length because it's a property, not a method. While we use () when using string.length() because it's a method.
